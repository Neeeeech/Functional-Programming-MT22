-- Q4 Bools
-- expressions of type Bool: True, False, True && False, (True && False) || True

-- function of type Bool -> (Bool -> Bool)
boolFunc1 :: Bool -> (Bool -> Bool)
-- if initial Bool is True, the function keeps the next value the same
-- if initial Bool is False, the function flips the next value
boolFunc1 a b = a == b

-- function of type (Bool -> Bool) -> Bool
boolFunc2 :: (Bool -> Bool) -> Bool
boolFunc2 f = f True

-- How many different functions of type Bool -> Bool are there?
-- There are 2 possible inputs, True and False. For each input, there are 2 possible outputs, True and False.
-- So, there are 2x2 ways to pick the outputs.
-- Hence, there are 4 different functions of type Bool -> Bool
